# IP_TP2 - Passing 29 of 29 tests! Yay!!

## Second programming project for the IP subject

To run the tests, navigate to the project directory and run:
```
python TestParser.py
```
The program will then run all tests and stop whenever an error is found

The tests output will be saved inside tests/TK/myOut with K being the number ID of the test
